## Methodology
The Travel Tickr project has been developed using agile principles, enabling efficient collaboration, iterative development, and effective project management. The following methodology has been employed throughout the project:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects has been utilized to facilitate agile project management. User stories and bugs have been organized as GitHub issues, allowing for a clear and structured approach to development. The project board in GitHub Projects serves as a Kanban board, providing an overview of the project's progress.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Each user story has been created as a GitHub issue, capturing the desired functionality from the user's perspective. The user stories are linked to their corresponding GitHub issues, allowing easy access to the acceptance criteria, tasks, and comments associated with each user story.

### Bug Tracking
Bugs encountered during the development process have also been logged as GitHub issues. These issues contain details about the specific bug, its impact, and steps to reproduce it. By linking the bugs in the README.md to their respective GitHub issues, users can gain insights into the bugs' resolution progress and view any additional comments.

### Iterative Development Approach
The Travel Tickr project follows an iterative development approach, allowing for continuous improvement and progress while adhering to time constraints. The development process is structured into sprints, with each sprint typically lasting around 6 days.

To ensure efficient prioritization, the project employs the MuSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) method. User stories critical to the app's success are categorized as Must-haves, followed by Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. You can refer to the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/SandraBergstrom/projects/7/views/1) to view the prioritization.

Within each sprint, a MoSCoW method is used to further prioritize user stories. They are classified as Must Do, Should Do, Could Do, and Won't Do, representing the remaining user stories that will not be included in the sprints. This approach ensures a clear differentiation between the overall project prioritization and the prioritization within each sprint, minimizing any potential confusion.

### Backlog and Subsequent Iterations 
The user stories are tracked on the project board, and the "To do" column represents the backlog of user stories (also see above), indicating the tasks that will be addressed in subsequent iterations.

Please note that even though the project timeline has been accelerated, the iterative development approach allows for ongoing improvements and enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users.

For a comprehensive view of the project progress, user stories, and bug tracking, please see the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/SandraBergstrom/projects/7).

## Deployment
The website was deployed using Heroku by following these steps:
1. Set DEBUG to False in the settings.py file.
2. Commit and push your code to the GitHub repository.
3. Clear the 'static' folder in Cloudinary to ensure the latest static files are used during deployment. This step is important to avoid any potential conflicts between cached versions of static files and the updated versions being deployed. Clearing the 'static' folder ensures that the latest versions of static files are used during the deployment process, preventing any eTag errors or inconsistencies.
4. Navigate to the project's deploy page in Heroku.
5. Choose the manual deployment option to deploy the latest code changes.

You can for fork the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on Fork button in upper right hand corner
3. Wait for the forking process to complete. Once done, you will have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

You can clone the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository

4. Open Git Bash (or your preferred terminal).
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
6. Type the command **'git clone'** followed by the URL you copied in step 3. The command should look like this: **git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY**.
